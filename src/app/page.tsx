            "About Blank Street\n\nAt Blank Street, we believe great coffee should be an everyday ritual. With shops across Brooklyn, Manhattan, Boston, DC, and London, we’re the first-ever brand to offer affordable high-quality coffee. Blank Street originated in an effort to change the specialty coffee status quo. Starting with small-format shops and continuing with a limited menu and top-of-the-line tech, we’ve always been focused on simplifying the coffee experience. We partner with amazing local vendors and brands, and have some of the best baristas out there on our team. Love coffee and customer service? Keep reading.\n\nWhat's Brewing...\n\nBlank Street is launching The Green Room, our first-ever concept store in Soho, New York City that will act as a product innovation and brand expression hub. In essence, the Green Room is just like any other Blank Street: it’s a daily ritual destination that enriches customers’ lives, with great coffee and friendly hospitality. There are two key areas that sets this store apart from the rest of Blank Street’s fleet:\n• Rotating Menu: This store will feature an exclusive rotating menu of beverages that you won’t see anywhere else. These beverages will be out-of-the-box, innovative, and conceptual in nature.\n• The Window: The store features a secondary point of sale - a hole-in-the-wall window that will be activated with rotating brand concepts.\n\nBaristas at Blank Street must be able to work independently, while also thriving in a team environment.
